The app is build using NewsApi with React,Redux,Typescript, React Router, using FontAwesome and Jest library. The process was challenging but it was all fun. Hope you enjoy my design too.

//fork to private, I followed the steps: https://www.travisgan.com/2022/08/github-create-private-fork-of-public.html and https://stackoverflow.com/questions/10065526/github-how-to-make-a-fork-of-public-repository-private
Your API key is: 822d02c1cb204781a8d67614b10f28f8

I habe deployed the app BUT: Actually newsapi.org api in developer plan is no more working in production. because in developer plan CORS is only enabled for localhost.

 So...You can download the app. Steps:
1.to download dependencies: npm install
2.to run the app: npm run dev
3.to run tests done only for the redux: npm test and npm test -- --coverage
